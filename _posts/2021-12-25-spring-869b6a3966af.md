# Spring

It’s raining in my mind,

But the smile never dies,

Feeling showered with fragrance,

In the rain and the fading mist.

I reach for you when I’m high,

But the mountains are quiet,

I can only hear my shivers,

In your cold black sweatshirt.

In the mid of the night,

Your memories come alive,

I search for you in the old days,

In the winter and the spring winds.

Then I go to our shrine,

Where our worlds come to life,

And I feel you and your essence,

Lovin’ me always since that spring…
