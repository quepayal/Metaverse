# Settle

I'm standing in dark and cold winter,\
My hands are stuck in an endless tune,\
Of us dancing across the street,\
Of your smile setting my heart free,\
Of the wind howling until we fell asleep.\
In our sleep is the spirit of fire,\
Kindling with the heart's desire,\
And it feeds the darkness with the light,\
Keeping you from erasing our lines,\
And it feels quite the night you admire.\
In the wind and sea, struggling for breath,\
But the shores scream when the waves turn on me,\
The stars are gazed by the eyes in the rest,\
The sky seems unfazed by the mire of your desire,\
Unsettling as ever, but wanting foreverâ€¦
