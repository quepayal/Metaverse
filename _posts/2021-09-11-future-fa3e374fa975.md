# Future

Think and flow in the ocean of thoughts,

Wondering the answer to where it all ends.

Crushed in the soul than in the fog of words,

Wondering where it all began,

Like the seasoned field of chaos,

Calling me in unknown worlds.

Wondering if I knew the way,

Of the reason to run away then face it in the face,

Are the endless possibilities of my future yet to be shaped.
