# Promises

The woods and ice in the sunkissed times,

Chasing winds disguised as warmth.

Fillinâ€™ the air with the unctuous aroma of love,

Invigorating my heart with the promises untold.

Unraveling the dark in the winter of fog,

Forgetting them in the first fall of snow.

In the world of lies, my truth stands by,

The promises are fine, but breaking them bleeds my sky.
