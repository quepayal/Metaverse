# Faraway, Faraway as I go

I see how it goes for you,

The Paris and bridge that day you knew,

Faraway, Faraway,

Out of reach, you go,

Leaving me strangling, with the thought of us.

You see how it goes for me,

Standing there outside in the cold,

Staring at the bridge as the Paris falls,

Underneath, Underneath,

In the ice I go, with you in the mirror floor.

By the time you come town alone,

As the night begin to fall,

And I’m gone so faraway, faraway,

Freezing cold as the breath lefts me alone,

I wonder if I ever come across.

In your thoughts as I leave this earth…
