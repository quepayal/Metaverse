# Autumn Shower

A strange smell perplexed in the atmosphere,
Beautiful chirps gliding around the pear.

A melodious fluid floods the mind,
Blue appearance seems kind.

Smell of nectar attracts the sucker,
Fallen yellow leaves mesmerizes the lover.

Kingly sun shining among the cluster of cushion,
Wingly wind blewing through the large cavern.

Centipede roaming in the topsy turvy world,
After a brief shower, wet and curled.

The moment of romance between the shivering trees,
Hearts sway in this beautiful scent.

Carried with love and peace,
Soft and cushion prone hands touching untouched spirit.

And every bit of it becomes the heart of livingâ€¦
