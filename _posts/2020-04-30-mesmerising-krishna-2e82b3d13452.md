# Mesmerising Krishna

Temples tuning, rhythm calming, Full moon lighting,

Smiling face watching, the familiar sound clinging.

Pleasant smell spreading, fresh breath in taking,

Smell of love dancing on the stage of affection.

Krishna smiling on his spellbound gopis,

Standing nearby Radha, gone heart of Krishna in a long saga.

Flute spreading wide, heavenly angles dancing bright.

Scenery of sunset romancing alight,

Beautiful ray of light glided on Krishna’s face.

Green eyes seems to be heavens rise,

Pink lips feeding on the taste of love.

Charming aurora glancing at Radha for seeking love,

Aurora ears searching for the music of Meera,

Soft words when escaped rinses like blessings.

The past unforgotten of the Savior of Dharma,

Who resides in the deep pure “Heartina” of his beloved.

Shaded by his flute’s shield of love,

Purely sung for love…
