# Origami Craft

Our story is like an origami craft,

Where we started off as unraveled papers,

And blended like perfect strokes of rose and wine,

Where I caress you and you always remain mine.

And if we ever unwind,

The dream and imagination are lost in infinite,

And I’ll be the Rose without wine.
