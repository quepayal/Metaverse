# Ending Scene

Life went good, so far, so deep,

And I got used to you, and I mean,

The flowers you brought are sinking deep,

As I go down now and I can’t feel.

This thunder that ruined you,

Your afterthought ruined me,

And there goes our life down a cliff,

And there goes our love so deep, so steep.

You never wonder why, the amber leaves,

To swim across the Nile like in a dutch sea,

To sail on the tide on the highest peak,

But now you lay like an ending scene.
