# Magnificent Shiva Ratri

Half hid, mist mild,

Winds blew, whispering true.

Message flew via air,

Blessing love throughout each layer.

Today two love birds gonna be theirs,

Deep heartina prime day spring.

Bangles stratify preeminence,

Halcyon hub suffuse it’s lord day.

Flowers budding grows their cushy fame,

Blossoms bloom in their lovely aroma.

Taste of love, fable of life,

Someone waiting for romeo alight.

Day spring skidding day break,

Ornaments blessing adorning beauty.

Elegant charm dazzling Parvati,

Thought flew onto someone.

The dazzling serenity of huge mountain sounds,

White locks scattered mild.

The crouching beauty shining amidst,

Aurora split on whose head.

Moon lit on whose charm,

Love cherishes on whose glimmer.

Marina Ganga merged in whose crowning glory,

The thought is hers and none of mine.

The novella versify Lord Shiva’s shine.

And thus they marry on that night,

The Magnificent Shiv Ratri…
