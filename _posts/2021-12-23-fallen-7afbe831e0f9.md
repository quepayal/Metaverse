# Fallen

Let me know you a little better,

Let me grow a little closer,

Let me feel you in this endless chaos,

To know the pain you’re hiding,

Show me the wounds that make you quiet.

I can change nothing in your past of memories,

But let me enter your fragmented present,

And I’ll weave it in your beautiful smile,

For a beautiful soul as yours,

I can’t let you get lost.

I might have fallen for you in this mist,

And for your kind ways, that I can’t resist,

From all the comets of smiles I’ve been through,

Yours is the brightest one that I didn't know,

Now that I’ve fallen in love with you…
