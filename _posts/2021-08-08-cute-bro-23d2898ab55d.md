# Cute bro

## I was pretty small when I wrote this for my younger brother…

Lushing cushion, soft prone hands,

Lovely cries created chaos in the healthy hands.

Today’s in fifteen, and I’ll tell you what happened that day,

The day was sunny. The dawn was 3, Awesomely June and year 2003.

The day was normal but only for me,

All the butterflies gathered near the Queen bee.

Life was to come to life,

Was planned to be welcomed by pleasure and anxiety.

Breath held gods were called,

Just when came life to live.

Dearness spread all around the world,

Quietness was disturbed in the most annoying tune.

I was excited wasn’t quite calm,

Was awaited to see the blazing light lit in the little face.

The day was celebrated with happiness and beauty,

Spreading around for the startling music.

The dawn was touching the horizon, and the dusk gathered in the sky,

The night was clear and bright.

The stars at peace and wind blowing in the hot summer as if dispersing Eva's beauty,

The moon glazing at the innocent face as if knitting the future of the tiny being.

Nature was the witness of the life of our life,

The life whom today I say my cute “bro”!
