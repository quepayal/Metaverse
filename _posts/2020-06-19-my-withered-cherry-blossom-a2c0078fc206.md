# My Withered Cherry Blossom

Universe says it’s autumn morning,

The heart believes it’s springtime.

And why not —

For it’s only been a while…

Last spring when you were there in my arms,

Now it’s only yellow leaves and fallen flowers.

The reflection in water were once your smile,

Now they’re pictures in my mind.

Didn’t know your footprints were so transient,

Now I don’t remember the sand once you walked upon.

You were like spring in my dark cold winter,

Didn’t realise the cherry blossoms also wither.

Do I hate this Autumn, that’s so live?

Probably because it took the spring of my life…
