# My Last Wish

## Today I was strangely thinking about my Last wish. I mean, if I die today, then what is highly likely to be my last wish?

And I thought and thought but couldn’t pinpoint anything.

I’ve few questions. So is Last wish something that we want to do in the present and die or that has to be done by someone after we die?

My answers vary according to the above conditions. If it’s for the present, I’d probably like to simultaneously travel the world and study mathematics or related beautiful stuff and, more importantly, spend time with my family on this earth. I’m already doing this except traveling!

And if it’s the other one, I’d wish happiness and health to my family and all those good people I came across throughout my life on this earth.

I can’t believe I’m so generous ;)

But really, the earth would be such a great place when we start to look at the world from the perspective of intellectual curiosity and humanity.
