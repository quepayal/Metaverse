# Sky of love

Fallen into winter,

Into your arms since I came to know you.

Your words feel like mid-summer,

I never thought I would miss you.

Every time I see you around,

My heart feels like it is longing for you.

Every instance of your sound,

Make me want to see you at once.

Wish itâ€™ll just end in spring,

And I just move around with you.

Thinking of you every time,

I think I get an inch closer to you.

Flowers in your hands and mine,

Thinking of love all this time.

Forever frozen thoughts,

And your eyes in mine.

You might think it's season but know my love for you is the Sky.
