# Dark woods

A white sky and my paintless brush,

Trying to paint the dark woods.

A portrait of someone worlds away,

With shades of purple in the water beneath.

The spotless sky with the tint of tides,

It makes me invisible in the reflection of light.

My drifting soul thinking all the way home,

Why do stars hide a broken comet flying high?

Maybe it’ll never reach my sky,

So you make it invisible tonight.

Thinkin’ I might witness it this night,

A black sky with your painted lies.
