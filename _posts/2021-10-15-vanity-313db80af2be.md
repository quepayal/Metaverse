# Vanity

There are expectations and then there are priorities.

Life in this desert of loneliness keeps being written and unwritten by the sand of memories.

Tuning radio in and out, flipping the pages further down.

Are the glimpse of those times spent with those now not around.

Standing atop my huge ego, facing the diminished version of my reality.

Looking up at the vast sky missing the reflection of my vanity.

Wondering if this universe still cares what I do here in these dunes of sand.

Iâ€™m the future missing piece of myself in the past of my insanity.
