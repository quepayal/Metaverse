# North Star

Walking alone by your side,

Swimming in your lavender-filled eyes.

Staring at the moonlight,

With your caffeinated smile.

Thereâ€™s a world above in the sky,

Painted with saffron and azure vibes.

With daffodils in your sight,

I become the shadow in your matte night.

Unwinding your hairs,

Makes me tangled more than ever.

And every snow in your winter,

Forms the fractals in my castle.

And every time you look up at the sky,

You search for the North Star in my memories tonight!
