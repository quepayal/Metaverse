# Silenzio, Bruno!

It’s the voice I hear,

Every day every night,

Every time, ever since.

The spark of which,

Silences my doubts.

The day I met you,

The courage flowed,

Like water on my skin.

And sparkling since,

It made me see me inside me.

When I let my fear down,

I see galaxies up around,

And shimmering waves of sound.

Whispering in my head,

Saying I can do it again.

When I see you again,

In the summer winds,

We’ll unwind those words.

We unknowingly said,

And sparkle all along, without the tint of the mist.

On the Vespa, we go,

Unfolding the world unknown.

And we kept saying,

When in doubt,

Shout it aloud!
