# Poetry by Heart

### This series is collection of my childhood poems composed by me…And don’t scroll too fast!

# Dies Irae in Sub Judice

I’m a girl, and feel proud to be,

To live in this world, I’m born to be.

From Mother’s protection,

I come out for due interaction.

With utmost simplicity, I trust everyone,

And believe that they would respect me and mine.

But today I’m curse to be born,

Through mother I’m chose to be torn.

Works assigned to me, role assigned to me.

Guilt assigned to me, blame assigned to me.

In my country evils surround me,

Danse macabre roams around me,

De facto it kicks at me.

It’s hell to be a girl in society like this,

Deo gratia help me to face those hungry wolves.

To chase them to their howling troops,

And here arrives…

Dies Irae in Sub Judice

## Rain

Gleaming and dutifully,

Rain come down.

Beautiful pearls just slide by,

Oh, adorning creatures come at dawn.

When everybody’s sleeping,

Just make the babble noise.

I would wake and greet you,

Thus will whole world wise.

Please give us relief,

From this scorching heat.

Come down one by one,

So that I can lean along my window.

Bring some hail with you,

When I come to see you.

Gleaming and dutifully,

Rain come down…

## A Departing Friend

Friends we meet, friends we depart,

Our well wishers someday leave us apart.

There’s nothing like friendship in this world of grace,

Friends mean to everyone when stuck in a case.

Lovely are those moments, grateful are those pleasant time,

When with those whom they I say they are mine.

My heart cries in this deaf world,

My eyes wait for their loving touch.

My ears stay keen to listen to those,

Uttered words of my dear departed friend.

My sense not knowing when we would meet,

Stays in the direction of future beneath.

May we meet again my friend and rejoice on our lovely essence.

The essence of love, of faith and touch…

## Journey in Train

Shake is on, fear is gone,

Treble shatter journey goes on.

Meet the world, meet the nature,

Fast forward going our life is like a searcher.

Day or night, With a siren or blue light,

Sun sets by, blue hills appear.

Daylight vanishes, our sleep come near,

It’s like a moving picture, bidding a sayonara.

Long long buildings pass by,

Yellow field waving a hi-fi.

Sometimes accelerating, sometimes decelerating,

Journey goes on just like a merry tale.

No one in this world experience a journey like this,

Only if is she travelling in a train with a SWISH…

## Weeping River

Pleasurably running, striking, babbling here I go,

Sometimes a river, sometimes a sea,

Sometimes an ocean here I bow.

But now neither I laugh, nor I smile,

Only there is black night.

My sons and daughters are killed before my eyes,

Hey humans! The mother whom you worshipped day and night,

Hoping to seek blessing might.

But who gave you right to ruin me and mine.

I weep, I cry over my dull skin,

Beware humans, control your habits.

If I rain my wrath you shall loose your might,

Says a waiting and weeping river…

## Sweet Teacher

You made me learn, you made me stand,

Today what I earn, is there you made me land.

Past looks like a golden age,

When your, glorious hands took me to the stage.

Now when you are leaving,

It feels as if dawn transitions to dusk.

What my life will be tomorrow, I don’t know,

But know that thy blessing will always be there as a rainbow.

Full of promise and blossoms…

## Love

Love a magical word, with a gold mine of meaning,

Composed of thoughts and full of feeling.

Different from greed and envy,

Love is an eternal kivi.

Come upon earth to unite us,

To wake the humanity in us.

History is the spectator,

Love is the ultimate teacher.

It rose the nationalism,

It bore the seed.

And developed an oak,

Out of small sapling free.

Some say love is our weakness,

But I say love is our ultimate strength.

Nothing could have ever been achieved,

If love had ever been blacked out.

Love is in you, Love is in me, Love is in our eyes,

Love is in nature, Love is eternal.

Love is divine, Love is god, Love is might,

Yet love conquers all, Let’s too yield to LOVE…

## Time

Time and tide waits for none,

God’s mightiest weapon is omnipotent.

Time is mightiest, time is strongest,

Nobody with stand time when it is to extremest.

The person who under estimate it,

Lose himself whole and not a bit.

Cleverness is in matching pace with time,

Not in trying to overtake him.

Many mighty powers are behind time,

In order to make their own shine.

But time is immortal,

Independent of anyone.

No one can ever deprive,

Time out of its power.

History is the evidence,

Time has kingly presence.

Sub rosa I reveal, Time is the godly stream,

Time is the devotion.

And yet devote your life to time.

Make the mightiest friend,

Make time your friend,

Your love, your essence…

## War

War, a deadly poison for a holy body,

A body whom did god made with love and affection, expecting same from them.

But from where did the black magic of satan broke,

Scattering the millions and billions of precious life of which we all are a part.

Threatening fears, scaring cries,

Deadly women kept her baby aside.

Ghostly hands, ruins the dream,

Human faces forces to weep.

Thousand standing on the door of death,

Within doom to sacrifice themselves.

Bloody hands haunts the city,

Every home become the cemetery.

Known people seems to be unknown,

A strange perplexed terrible atmosphere.

Like as if dusk is forever,

Life’s struggling for the beginning of a bright sun.

Shinning without any threat or fear,

Followed by twilight.

The night of quietness and peacefulness.

Full of twinkling creatures,

And a New Saga Moon…

## The Undying Spirit

They killed but whom, they harmed but whom,

They tortured but whom, they murdered but whom.

She has not died, nor will die and have never died,

They cannot kill her, because she’s eternal.

They cannot harm her, because she’s spiritual,

They cannot torture her, because she’s divine.

They cannot murder her, because she’s the undying spirit,

In the veil of darkness, she came across the ghastly wolves, hidden on earth in impure humanity.

Taking advantage of majority,

They jumped over ever level of heinous act.

She roared in pain, a pain given to lioness,

She shed blood, blood of pious being.

Jewel of god, adorning Eva’s beauty,

Devil you won’t be spared.

Would surely be punished for your ghastly deeds,

Thus thy die the death that even death would fear.

Her death was not useless,

She rose the revolt against this nefarious act.

No one can kill her, because she’s the undying spirit…

## Resonance

Music pleasing my soul, resonating with my spirit,

My mind dancing the way, rain drops on earth,

Universe witnessing my spirit romancing alight through the spills of Aurora.

A brief shower blessing through my devoted soul,

Trees glancing with their heart flourished,

A mild wind filling the mind with lovely aroma of blessings,

And a clear night sky with a moon to admire.

A cold touch of morning crush,

Humming hymn like a lovelorn’s song,

Yellow leaves harmonising symphonic tune,

Resonating aura adorning the universe with Cafelmusite Muzak…
