# Endless Universe

Crystal and I want to hear you, not hide,

Filters hide the sky, and that’s what I don’t like,

Purpose in my life, finding the way I might have long back,

Meanings are shy and follow wherever the sky seems high.

In this endless universe of mine, time seems to fly,

Filled with the dust from the past, it becomes an impenetrable path,

Maybe the sky often lies, in my delusional starry night,

But when I see you smile, my delusional sky fills with light,

In this endless universe of mine, you’re the traveler, and I’m your mind.
