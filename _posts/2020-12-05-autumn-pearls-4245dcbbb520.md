# Autumn Pearls

Pearls clouding the once ocean clear world,

To rain down on my rosy cheeks,

Infiltrating my smile,

Till they taste of abandoned memories.

Picture perfect I may seem to you,

Pearl after pearl they grew as you,

And I hold them close and tight,

Till they run in presence of you.

Autumn fills my heart with you,

And the path we walked,

Is the strange affair of amber and gold,

Seasons change but they think of you.

Pearls froze till they hurt me as you,

Ain’t it better to leave them with you,

The way you change,

You make all seasons shy.

As you shower down as leaves of maple on my path 🍁.
