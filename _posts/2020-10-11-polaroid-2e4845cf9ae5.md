# Polaroid

Tell me, what are you feeling in the dark,

When you close your eyes,

What’s painted all around?

Is it the endless ocean that even sinks the sky,

Or the clouds of memories that make you smile?

In my reflection, I see the love of my life,

The scene is well lit with sunshine upon him,

The wind is light, and airy stardust fills the sky,

The smile is so captivating, and his hairs almost hide his eyes,

As he captures the world in his polaroid,

I capture him in mine…
