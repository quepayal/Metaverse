# Your Thought

Someday some evening when the sky’s turning red,

And orange sun fades into the horizon,

I’ll still be thinking about you.

Like a wanderer in search of peace,

Traveling through the winds,

And the sand under my feet.

A spot I remember full of memories,

And I absentmindedly stop to glance,

Of what we were and what we could have been.
